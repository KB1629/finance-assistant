# 🔧 Issues Fixed - December 28, 2024

## 🚨 **Issues Identified from Screenshots:**

### Issue 1: ITC Stock Data Not Recognized ❌
**Problem**: User asked "How is ITC performing in the Indian market" but AI responded "I lack specific data on ITC"
**Root Cause**: Indian stocks were in demo data but not in the actual portfolio

### Issue 2: "Play Response" Button Bug ❌  
**Problem**: Clicking "Play Response" made the AI response disappear, forcing user to re-enter query
**Root Cause**: Streamlit state management issue with button interaction

### Issue 3: Holdings Count Shows 0 ❌
**Problem**: Portfolio dashboard showed "Holdings: 0" instead of actual count
**Root Cause**: Looking for wrong key in portfolio data structure
